## 💡 Vision

Most recipe websites are cluttered with ads, slow, and frustrating to use.  
**My Family Table** is designed to be:

- **clean** (no clutter, no ads)  
- **family-friendly** (recipes kids actually enjoy)  
- **smart** (AI search by ingredients, coming soon).  

✨ *Built during my return to tech after a long maternity break, inspired by my daughter’s strong character and our joyful kitchen experiments together.*
